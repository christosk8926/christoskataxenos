I thought the hard part was getting accepted into the University. How innocent I was.

Almost 2 months after the start of my studies, and having a "random" idea about the university, I started studying just as I had learned in the **ancient years** when I was still in school.

We barely start, and already from the 1st week, they send us the topics for our first Written Assignments. And that's when I realize that Computer Science at HOU isn't just coding, it's **panic management**.

For the 2 courses I chose for my 1st year, fortunately, **Morpheus** got into my head and made me think logically. I chose ONLY 2. I wrote quite well (almost perfectly I would say, if I had the brains I had in high school).

But a week after we got the grades, the **2nd Written Assignment** drops. And that's when the party starts: not even understanding the problem statements.

BUT, that's why we are here. To make it.

## The Equation of Despair

As a young scientist (not in age, but in the world of science), I tried to model my situation programmatically. I discovered that study efficiency ($E$) is inversely proportional to the volume of information ($I$) and the square of open tabs in the browser ($T$).

```math
E = 1 / (I * T^2)
```

In short: The more tabs I have open to find "the solution", the less I understand what's going on.

## The Study Algorithm

I tried to organize my schedule by writing a Python script. The logic was simple: *"While I have energy, I study"*.

Unfortunately, I forgot to calculate the "Social Media" factor and the script entered an infinite loop of procrastination.

```python
import time
import random

def study_session(energy_level):
    caffeine_intake = 0
    
    while energy_level > 0:
        print("Reading paragraph 3...")
        time.sleep(1) # Simulation of concentration
        
        # The system bug
        distraction = random.choice([
            "Discord", 
            "Fridge", 
            "Craving sweet or salty"
        ])
        
        if distraction:
            print(f"Critical Error: Distracted by {distraction}")
            energy_level -= 10
            caffeine_intake += 1
            
        if caffeine_intake > 5:
            print("Warning: Hands are shaking. Abort mission.")
            break

    return "I'll start on Monday"

# Run at your own risk
status = study_session(100)
print(status)
```
