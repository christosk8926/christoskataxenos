<Stats panicLevel={95} coffeeCups={4} hoursSpent={6} />

I thought the hard part was to get `successfully enrolled`. How innocent I was. Like a Junior Dev thinking they can deploy on a Friday afternoon and everything will go fine.

Almost 2 months after the start, and having a —let's call it— "abstract" idea of what the **Hellenic Open University (HOU)** is, I started studying with the mindset I had in **legacy systems** (see: High School).

**Fatal Error.**

## The Discovery of GE_Protocol

We barely boot up the semester and already by the 1st week a notification pops up: **Topics for the 1st Written Assignment (WA)**.

That's exactly where the context switch happens. I realize that Computer Science at HOU isn't just coding. It's **Distributed Panic Management**.

<Callout type="info" title="The Morpheus Effect">
For the 1st year courses, thankfully Morpheus got into my head before I made my declaration. He offered me the blue pill (3 modules) and the red pill (2 modules).
I took the red one. **I chose ONLY 2**.
</Callout>

In the first WA, I scored almost perfectly. Morale went up. I felt like a hacker.

And then, exactly one week after the results, the event is triggered: **2nd Written Assignment**. And that's where the real party starts: reading the problem statement and parsing failing miserably.

## The Equation of Despair (Math Block Edition)

As a young scientist, I tried to model my situation. I discovered that study efficiency ($E$) is inversely proportional to the volume of information ($I$) and the square of open tabs in the browser ($T$).

```math
E = \frac{1}{I \times T^2} + \lim_{coffee \to \infty} (Panic)
```

In short: The more tabs I have open on Stack Overflow to find "the solution", the more `understanding` tends to zero.

## The Algorithm of (Non) Study

I tried to organize my schedule by writing a Python script. The logic was simple: *"While I have energy, I do processing"*.

Unfortunately, I forgot to handle the environment exceptions (see: Social Media) and the script entered an infinite loop of procrastination.

```python
import time
import random

def study_session(energy_level):
    caffeine_intake = 0
    
    # Main Loop of despair
    while energy_level > 0:
        print(f"Stats: Energy={energy_level}% | Coffee={caffeine_intake}")
        print("Processing paragraph 3...")
        time.sleep(1) # Concentration simulation (not really)
        
        # The system bug (Distractions)
        distraction = random.choice([
            "Discord Notification", 
            "Is the Fridge empty?", 
            "Debugging on Facebook wall",
            None
        ])
        
        if distraction:
            print(f"CRITICAL ERROR: Context Switch to '{distraction}'")
            energy_level -= 15
            caffeine_intake += 1
            
        if caffeine_intake > 5:
            # Hardware failure imminent
            return "System Overload: Hands are shaking. Abort mission."

    return "Exception: I'll start on Monday"

# Run at your own risk
status = study_session(100)
```
